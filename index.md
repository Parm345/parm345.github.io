# About Me

Hey there! My name is Parm and I'm working towards earning a Mechanical Engineering degree. I'm a Linux and FOSS enthusiast who likes tinkering around with computers. [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) is distro I have been daily driving for about 5 years and I can recommend it to anyone who wants a stable desktop Linux experience. This website exists to act as both my portfolio and resume. Feel free to contact me with any method scattered across this page.

## Education

# Projects

## CAD (Computer Aided Design)

### RSX Arm URDF

### Gearbox 

## Software

### [rsx-rover](https://github.com/rsx-utoronto/rsx-rover) ROS Package

As a member of RSX I have contributed greatly to the software on the rover. Specifically, I developed a ros node that performs analytic inverse kinematics on a 6 degree of freedom arm and integrated the arm visualization system into RViz. The arm visualization shows both the targeted arm position and the position the real arm currently is in. Some other stuff I've worked on or learned are simulation of the arm in gazebo, depth cameras, PID control, and CAN bus.

Future projects for the arm involve autonomously controlling it using path planning algorithms and sensing the environment using computer vision.


### [Generic Gun Shooter](https://battlemonk345.itch.io/generic-gun-shooter)

Generic Gun Shooter was a submission to the 2023 GMTK game jam that me and a friend developed in Godot. The theme of the jam was "Rolls Reversed" which we interpreted as swapping the rolls of bullet and gun because it's kind of funny. I worked on some art assets and created a Finite State Machine to control the enemy soldiers.

### [Slide of Dice](https://battlemonk345.itch.io/slide-of-dice)

This was my first ever submission to a game jam (the 2022 GMTK game jam to be specific) which I worked on with a friend. The theme of the jam was "Roll of a Dice" which we implemented as solving a platforming problem by rolling dice to act as platforms to reach the end of the level. I worked on the art assets and code of the game.

### Godot Behavior Tree

This project is currently work in progress. I am developing a behavior tree plugin for godot using GDExtension - a tool that let's you write plugins for godot using C++.
