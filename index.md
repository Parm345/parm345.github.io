# About Me

Hey there! My name is Parm and I'm working towards earning a Mechanical Engineering degree. I'm a Linux and FOSS enthusiast who likes tinkering around with computers. [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) is distro I have been daily driving for about 5 years and I can recommend it to anyone who wants a stable desktop Linux experience. This website exists to act as both my portfolio and resume. Feel free to contact me with any method scattered across this page.

## Education

### [**Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc), Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/programs/undergraduate/mechanical-engineering/) | University of Toronto

#### 2021 - Present

I'm currently in my third year and expecting to graduate in 2026 because of the PEY program. I have chosen the Bioengineering and Mechatronics streams and I plan to pursue minors in Bioengineering and Robotics. 

## Experience 

### Robotics For Space Exploration (RSX)

#### Arm Control Software Lead | September 2022 - Present

#### Arm Team Member | May 2022 - August 2022

### MIE243 Pick and Place Machine Project

### APS112 Handless Garbage Opener Project

## Certifications

### SOLIDWORKS Associate in Mechanical Design
ID: 

### Basic Maching 
I received basic machine shope training (lathe, milling machine, and drill press) from George Brown College.

# Projects

## CAD (Computer Aided Design)

### Pick and Place Machine

### RSX Arm URDF

### Gearbox 

## Software

### [rsx-rover](https://github.com/rsx-utoronto/rsx-rover) ROS Package

As a member of RSX I have contributed greatly to the software on the rover. Specifically, I developed a ros node that performs analytic inverse kinematics on a 6 degree of freedom arm and integrated the arm visualization system into RViz. The arm visualization shows both the targeted arm position and the position the real arm currently is in. Some other stuff I've worked on or learned are simulation the arm in gazebo, depth cameras, PID control, and CAN bus.

Future projects for the arm involve autonomously controlling it using path planning algorithms and sensing the environment using computer vision.
